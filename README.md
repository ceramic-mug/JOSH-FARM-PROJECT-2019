# FARM PROJECT 2019 ~ Joshua Eastman

This repository holds an annotated copy of the scripts and workflows that I put together for the PEI 2019 Farm Project. This README file will give you a detailed overview of the work. All files and folders referenced here are within this repository. To access and use the code, simply download this repository as a zip file and follow the steps below for installing python and necessary python modules.

I wish you well!

## Project Arms
1. Arable Sensor Data
2. Drone Imagery
3. Other Data
    - Bugs
    - Soil Nutrients
    - Camera Traps

Each of these project arms were approached somewhat differently due to differences in the data structures. The Arable Sensor and Drone Imagery data wrangling applications presented in this repository are built around the Arable and FieldAgent specifications, respectively. Bug, soil nutrient, and camera trap data are all held in spreadsheets and so are handled much more simply. We will begin our overview with a detailed description of Arable data handling.

## ARABLE
The arable sensors are stationary UFO-shaped things on poles that stick up above crop canopies. They gather atmospheric and spectrometric data and report the data in two resolutions: daily and hourly.

- Link to our Arable portal: [https://princeton.arable.com/](https://princeton.arable.com/auth/(auth_view:login))
- Link to the Arable API documentation: [https://pro-soap.cloudvent.net/](https://pro-soap.cloudvent.net/)

I know that last link looks sketchy, and you'll be directed to a really sketchy-looking page that says "FREE PLAN," but that's actually the documentation page. Go ahead and click through the scary blue button and you'll land on the true Arable API documentation site. I used it to build my program, so I know it's the right stuff.

### Getting the Data
- File: [./src/dataGrep.py](./src/dataGrep.py)

All the Arable sensors in the field are connected to a server at all times. THIS METHOD FOR GETTING THE DATA WORKS AS LONG AS THE SENSOR IS ON AND ACTIVELY REPORTING. If the sensor is turned off or nonfunctional, THIS METHOD WILL NOT WORK because the sensor will not be in the list of active sensors accessed by this program. But as long as all sensors are on and active, this program will work great.
